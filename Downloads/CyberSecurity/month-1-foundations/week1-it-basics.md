# 🖥️ Week 1: IT Basics – How Computers and the Internet Work

## 📌 Goals:
- Understand how computers function at a basic level
- Learn how the internet works (IP, DNS, HTTP, etc.)
- Understand the OSI model (critical for pentesting)
- Set up your working environment (Kali Linux + VirtualBox)

## 💡 Core Concepts

### 🧠 Computer Basics
- CPU: Executes instructions
- RAM: Temporary memory for active processes
- Storage: HDD/SSD for persistent data
- BIOS/UEFI: Bootloader before OS
- OS: Manages hardware & software

### 🌐 Internet & Networking
- IP Addressing (IPv4 basics)
- DNS: Domain to IP resolution
- MAC Address: Hardware address (Layer 2)
- HTTP vs HTTPS
- Ports & Protocols (TCP/UDP)

### 📦 OSI Model (7 Layers)
| Layer | Name              | Example |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| 7     | Application       | HTTP, DNS |
| 6     | Presentation      | SSL, TLS |
| 5     | Session           | NetBIOS |
| 4     | Transport         | TCP, UDP |
| 3     | Network           | IP |
| 2     | Data Link         | MAC Address |
| 1     | Physical          | Cables, NIC |

## 🛠️ Practice Tasks
- Watch: [How the Internet Works in 5 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc)
- Try: `ping`, `traceroute`, `ipconfig`, `nslookup`, `netstat`
- Set up VirtualBox + Kali Linux VM

## ✅ Checklist
- [ ] Understand how DNS works
- [ ] Can explain the OSI model from memory
- [ ] Set up Kali in VirtualBox
