# 🌐 Week 3: Networking – The Hacker’s Playground

## 📌 Goals:
- Understand practical networking tools and protocols
- Use packet analysis and port scanning tools
- Identify common services and vulnerabilities

---

## 🧠 Core Topics

### 🕸️ Networking Tools
- `ifconfig`, `ip`, `netstat`, `ss`
- `nmap` – Port scanning & enumeration
- `traceroute`, `ping`, `dig`, `nslookup`
- `tcpdump`, `wireshark`

### 🌐 Common Ports
| Port | Protocol | Service     |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 22   | TCP      | SSH         |
| 80   | TCP      | HTTP        |
| 443  | TCP      | HTTPS       |
| 21   | TCP      | FTP         |
| 139  | TCP      | SMB         |

### 📡 Packet Capture
- Capture and filter with Wireshark
- Understand 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)

---

## 🛠️ Practice Tasks
- Scan your own machine with `nmap`
- Capture DNS and HTTP traffic with Wireshark
- Identify the handshake in TCP traffic

---

## ✅ Checklist
- [ ] Know top 10 ports by heart
- [ ] Can run and interpret a basic `nmap` scan
- [ ] Captured HTTP login request in Wireshark
